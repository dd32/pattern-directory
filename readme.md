# WordPress.org Pattern Directory

## Prerequisites
- Docker
- Node/NPM
- Composer

## Setup
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run create`
3. Visit site at `localhost:8888`

### Stopping & Starting Environment

If you need to work on another project, your environment can be safely stopped with:

	npm run wp-env stop

When you want to come back to work, bring the project back up with:

	npm run wp-env start

Make sure you're in the project root (same as `.wp-env.json`), otherwise `wp-env` will create a new site instance in one of the sub-projects (and you'll spend a while wondering why nothing's synced ðŸ¤¨).

### WP-CLI Commands

You can run wp-cli commands on your site using the cli container. Send any command to it like this:

	npm run wp-env run cli "theme list"

### Removing Environment

To remove your environment entirely, you can [destroy it.](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/master/packages/env#6-nuke-everything-and-start-again-) This will wipe everything associated with your site!

	npm run wp-env destroy

## Development

While working on the theme & plugin, you might need to rebuild the CSS or JavaScript.

To build both projects, you can run:

	npm run build --workspaces

To build one at a time, run

	npm run --workspace=wporg-pattern-directory

If you want to watch for changes, run `start`. This can only be run in one project at a time:

	npm start --workspace=wporg-pattern-directory

### Workspaces

The available workspaces are:

	"wporg-pattern-creator": "public_html/wp-content/plugins/pattern-creator"
	"wporg-pattern-directory": "public_html/wp-content/plugins/pattern-directory"
	"wporg-pattern-directory-theme": "public_html/wp-content/themes/pattern-directory"

### Linting

This project has eslint, stylelint, and phpcs set up for linting the code. This ensures all developers are working from the same style. To check your code before pushing it to the repo, run

	npm run lint:css --workspaces
	npm run lint:js --workspaces
	composer run lint

These checks will also be run automatically on each PR.
